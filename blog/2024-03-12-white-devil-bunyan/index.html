      <p>The doctrine of coming to Jesus Christ for life reveals the evil of unbelief, the wicked thing that is the main hindrance to the coming sinner. Does the text say, “Come”? Does it say, “And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out”? Then, what an evil it is that keeps sinners from coming to Jesus Christ! And that evil is unbelief, for by faith we come; by unbelief we stay away. Therefore, it is that by which a soul is said to depart from God, because it was that which at first caused the world to go off from him, and that also which keeps them from him to this day. And it does it more easily because it does it with cunning.</p>

<p>This sin may be called the white devil. For it often, in its mischievous actions in the soul, appears as if it were an angel of light; indeed, it acts like a counselor from heaven. Therefore, to discuss this evil disease a little, I observe:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It is that sin, above all others, that has some semblance of reason in its attempts. For it keeps the soul from Christ by pretending its present unfitness and unpreparedness: such as a lack of a stronger sense of sin, of more repentance, more humility, and a more broken heart.</li>
  <li>It is the sin that most aligns with the conscience. The conscience of the coming sinner tells him that he has nothing good, that he stands accused for ten thousand talents; that he is a very ignorant, blind, and hard-hearted sinner, unworthy to be noticed by Jesus Christ. And will you (says unbelief) in such a state as you are now, presume to come to Jesus Christ?</li>
  <li>It is the sin that most aligns with our sense of feeling. The coming sinner feels the workings of sin, of all kinds of sin and wretchedness in his flesh; he also feels the wrath and judgment of God due to sin and often staggers under it. Now, (says unbelief) you can see you have no grace, for what works in you is corruption. You can also perceive that God does not love you, because the sense of his wrath remains upon you. Therefore, how can you have the face to come to Jesus Christ?</li>
  <li>It is that sin above all others that most aligns with the wisdom of our flesh. The wisdom of our flesh thinks it prudent to question for a while, to stand back for a while, to listen to both sides for a while, and not to be rash, sudden, or unwise in too bold a presumption upon Christ. And this wisdom unbelief falls in with.</li>
  <li>It is the sin above all others that continually whispers in the ear of the soul, with doubts about the faithfulness of God in keeping his promise to those who come to Jesus Christ for life. It also suggests doubts about Christ’s willingness to receive and save him. And no sin can do this as artfully as unbelief.</li>
  <li>It is also that sin which is always ready to object against this or that promise that the Spirit of God brings to our hearts to comfort us. And if the poor coming sinner is not aware of it, unbelief will quickly take the promise away from him by some demand, slight, trick, or quibble, and he shall have little benefit from it.</li>
  <li>It is that sin above all others that weakens our prayers, our faith, our love, our diligence, our hope, and our expectations. It even takes the heart away from God in duty.</li>
  <li>Lastly, this sin, as I have said, even now, appears in the soul with so many sweet pretenses to greater safety and security that it is, as it were, counsel sent from heaven, advising the soul to be wise, wary, considerate, well-advised, and to take heed of too rash a venture upon believing. “Be sure, first, that God loves you; take hold of no promise until you are compelled by God to do so; neither be sure of your salvation; doubt it still, though the testimony of the Lord has often been confirmed in you. Live not by faith, but by sense; and when you can neither see nor feel, then fear and mistrust, then doubt and question everything.” This is the devilish counsel of unbelief, which is so covered over with plausible pretenses that the wisest Christian can hardly shake off these reasonings.</li>
</ol>

<p>But to be brief, let me give the Christian reader a more particular description of the qualities of unbelief by contrasting it with faith in these particulars:</p>

<p>Faith believes the word of God, but unbelief questions its certainty (Psalm 106:24).</p>

<p>Faith believes the word because it is true, but unbelief doubts it because it is true (1 Timothy 4:3; John 8:45).</p>

<p>Faith sees more in a promise of God to help than in all other things to hinder, but unbelief, despite God’s promise, says, “How can these things be?” (Romans 4:19-21; 2 Kings 7:2; John 3:11,12).</p>

<p>Faith will make you see love in the heart of Christ even when he reproves you, but unbelief will imagine wrath in his heart even when he says he loves us (Matthew 15:22-29; 25:24).</p>

<p>Faith will help the soul to wait, even though God delays to give, but unbelief will take offense and give up if God delays (Psalm 25:5; Isaiah 8:17; 2 Kings 6:33).</p>

<p>Faith will give comfort in the midst of fears, but unbelief causes fears in the midst of comforts (2 Chronicles 20:20,21; Matthew 8:26; Luke 24:25). Faith will find sweetness in God’s rod, but unbelief can find no comfort in his greatest mercies (Psalm 23; Numbers 12).</p>

<p>Faith makes great burdens light, but unbelief makes light ones intolerably heavy (Malachi 1:12,13). Faith helps us when we are down, but unbelief throws us down when we are up (Micah 7:8-10; Hebrews 4:11).</p>

<p>Faith brings us near to God when we are far from him, but unbelief puts us far from God when we are near to him (Hebrews 10:22; 3:12,13). Where faith reigns, it declares us to be the friends of God, but where unbelief reigns, it declares us to be his enemies (Hebrews 3:18; Revelation 21:8).</p>

<p>Faith puts us under grace, but unbelief holds us under wrath (Romans 3:24-26; Ephesians 2:8; John 3:36; 1 John 5:10; Hebrews 3:17; Mark 16:16; John 8:24).</p>

<p>Faith purifies the heart, but unbelief keeps it polluted and impure (Acts 15:9; Titus 1:15,16). By faith, the righteousness of Christ is imputed to us, but unbelief shuts us up under the law to perish (Romans 4:23,24; 11:32; Galatians 3:23).</p>

<p>Faith makes our work acceptable to God through Christ, but whatever is of unbelief is sin. For without faith, it is impossible to please him (Hebrews 11:4; Romans 14:23; Hebrews 11:6).</p>

<p>Faith gives us peace and comforts our souls, but unbelief works trouble and tossings, like the restless waves of the sea (Romans 5:1; James 1:6).</p>

<p>Faith makes us see preciousness in Christ, but unbelief sees no form, beauty, or comeliness in him (1 Peter 2; Isaiah 53:1-3). By faith, we have our life in Christ’s fullness, but by unbelief, we starve and pine away (Galatians 2:20).</p>

<p>Faith gives us victory over the law, sin, death, the devil, and all evils, but unbelief lays us open to them all (1 John 5:4; Luke 12:46).</p>

<p>Faith will show us more excellency in things not seen than in those that are, but unbelief sees more in things that are than in things that will be hereafter (2 Corinthians 4:18; Hebrews 11:24-27; 1 Corinthians 15:32).</p>

<p>Faith makes the ways of God pleasant and admirable, but unbelief makes them heavy and hard (Galatians 4:6; 2 Corinthians 12:10,11; John 6:60; Psalm 2:3).</p>

<p>By faith, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob possessed the promised land, but because of unbelief, neither Aaron, Moses, nor Miriam could enter there (Hebrews 11:9; 3:19). By faith, the Israelites passed through the Red Sea, but because of unbelief, the majority of them perished in the wilderness (Hebrews 11:29; Jude 5). By faith, Gideon achieved more with three hundred men and a few empty pitchers than all the twelve tribes could achieve, because they did not believe God (Judges 7:16-22; Numbers 14:11,14). By faith, Peter walked on water, but because of unbelief, he began to sink (Matthew 14:22-33).</p>

<p>Many more examples could be added, but for the sake of brevity, I omit them, urging everyone who thinks they have a soul to save or be damned to take heed of unbelief, lest, since there is a promise left us of entering his rest, any of us should indeed fall short of it because of unbelief.</p>
