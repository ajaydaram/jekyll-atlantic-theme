      <p><strong>On the Fear of the Lord as It Pertains to the Word of God:</strong></p>

<p>I will now address the second point: the rule and guide for our fear of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>SECOND.</strong> The word “fear” is sometimes used to mean <strong>the Word of God</strong>, because the written Word of God is and should be the rule and guide for our fear of the Lord. This is what David refers to in the nineteenth Psalm: “The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.” Here, “the fear of the Lord” means the Word of the Lord, the written Word. In the same passage, he also refers to the law, statutes, commandments, and judgments of God: “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple; the statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.” All these terms refer to the same thing: the Word of God, highlighting its glory. Among these phrases, one is, “The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.” This written Word is therefore the object of a Christian’s fear.</p>

<p>This is also what David meant when he said, “Come, you children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord” (Psalm 34:11). By “fear,” he meant the commandments, statutes, and judgments of the Lord, as Moses commanded the children of Israel: “You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up” (Deuteronomy 6:4-7).</p>

<p>The same idea is present in Isaiah 11, where the Father says of the Son that He shall be quick to understand the fear of the Lord, so that He may judge and strike the earth with the rod of His mouth. This rod is the fear, the Word of the Lord, for He was to be quick to understand it so that He could execute it according to His Father’s will among the children of men. This, as I mentioned, is called the fear of the Lord because it is the rule and guide of our fear. We do not know how to fear the Lord in a saving way without its guidance and direction. Just as the priest was sent back from captivity to Samaria to teach the people to fear the Lord, the written Word is given to us and left among us so that we may read it all the days of our lives and learn to fear the Lord (Deuteronomy 6:1-3, 24; 10:12; 17:19).</p>

<p>God Himself takes notice of and praises those who tremble at His Word, as in the case of Josiah (2 Chronicles 34:26-27). Such people are approved by God, even if condemned by others: “Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at His word: Your brethren who hated you, who cast you out for My name’s sake, said, ‘Let the Lord be glorified,’ but He shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed” (Isaiah 66:5).</p>

<p>Moreover, God will look to, care for, and protect those who tremble at His Word, ensuring that no distress, temptation, or affliction overcomes and destroys them: “To this man will I look,” says God, “even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word” (Isaiah 66:2). This is similar to what is said in Isaiah 57:15: “For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.”</p>

<p>The way to avoid foretold dangers is to listen to, understand, and fear the Word of God: “He who feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses, and they were safe; but he who did not regard the word of the Lord left his servants and his livestock in the field, and they were destroyed by the hail” (Exodus 9:20-25).</p>

<p>When the sins of a nation or church are exposed and mourned, it is by those who know and tremble at the Word of God. When Ezra heard of his brethren’s wickedness and sought to humble himself before God, who joined him? Those who trembled at the Word of God: “Then were assembled unto me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those who had been carried away” (Ezra 9:4). Those who tremble at the Word are also the best advisors in matters of God, as their judgment aligns with His will: “Now therefore, let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the foreign wives, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the law” (Ezra 10:3).</p>

<p>The dread and terror of the Word lie in these things.</p>

<p><strong>First.</strong> As I have already mentioned, these words come from God. When Moses and the prophets delivered their messages, they always said, “Hear the word of the Lord,” or “Thus saith the Lord,” and similar phrases. For instance, when Ezekiel was sent to the house of Israel, he was instructed to say, “Thus saith the Lord God” (Ezek. 2:4, 3:11). This emphasizes the honor and majesty God has placed on His written Word, intending for it to be the rule and guide for our fear and reverence. When Habakkuk heard the word of the Lord, his belly trembled, and rottenness entered his bones. He said, “I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble” (Hab. 3:16). The word of a king is as the roaring of a lion; where the word of a king is, there is power. What is it, then, when God, the great God, roars out of Zion and utters His voice from Jerusalem, shaking not only the earth but also heaven? As David puts it, “The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty” (Psalm 29).</p>

<p><strong>Second.</strong> The Word is fearful and may well be called the fear of the Lord because of its subject matter—the state of sinners in the next world. The whole Bible addresses this, either directly or indirectly. All its doctrines, counsels, encouragements, threats, and judgments concern us with respect to our eternal state. Jesus said, “The word that I have spoken, it shall judge you in the last day” (John 12:48). Considering our next state will be eternal, either eternal glory or eternal fire, and that this is determined by God’s words in the Scriptures, we should tremble at His Word. The Scriptures teach us how to please God in everything.</p>

<p><strong>Third.</strong> The Word is called fearful because of its truth and faithfulness. The Scriptures cannot be broken. They are called the Scriptures of truth, the true sayings of God, and the fear of the Lord because every jot and tittle is forever settled in heaven, more steadfast than the world. Jesus said, “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away” (Matt. 24:35). Those favored by God’s Word are truly favored, and no one can change that. But those condemned by the Scriptures cannot be justified by anyone. What is bound by the text is bound, and what is released is released; this bond and release are unalterable (Dan. 10:21; Rev. 19:9; Matt. 24:35; Psalm 119:89; John 10:35). Therefore, God’s people should fear His Word more than all the world’s terrors. The lack of reverence for the Word is the root of all disorders in heart, life, conversation, and Christian communion. Disrespect for the Word brings God’s displeasure—”Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed; but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded” (Prov. 13:13).</p>

<p>All transgression begins with straying from God’s Word. David said, “By the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer” (Psalm 17:4). Solomon advised, “My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings; let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart; for they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh” (Prov. 4:20-22). If you would truly respect the Word of the Lord and make it your guide in all things, believe that the Word is the fear of the Lord and stands forever. God will do nothing against His Word, either in saving or damning souls.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Know that those who do not regard the Word of the Lord and make it their fear, but instead follow the lust of their flesh, the desire of their eyes, and the pride of life, are rebuked by this doctrine and are counted fools. “They have rejected the word of the Lord, and what wisdom is in them?” (Jer. 8:9). This rebellion was present then and persists today. People say, “We will not hearken unto thee, but we will certainly do whatever goes forth out of our own mouth” (Jer. 44:16). Such rebellion leads to destruction, as with Korah and his company, who perished because they rejected the word, the fear of the Lord (Num. 26:9-10).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If God’s words are the fear of the Lord, this rebukes those who esteem the words and things of men more than God’s words. Some acknowledge the authority of the Word yet do not obey it. Jesus said, “Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed” (Mark 8:38).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will become of those who mock and disdain God’s words, making them seem ridiculous? Their judgment is sure and will come without remedy (2 Chron. 36:15). Those who deny its authority and raise doubts against it will be judged by the Word in the last day (1 Peter 2:8; John 12:48).</p>
  </li>
</ol>
