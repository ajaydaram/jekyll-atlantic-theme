      <p>Galatians 6:14-18:</p>

<p>“But as for me, may I never boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation. Peace and mercy to all who walk by this rule—to the Israel of God. From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.”</p>

<p>“We have seen before that Paul condemned those who only wanted to please the world and avoid persecution, even if it meant distorting the gospel. We still see many examples of this today. Pure doctrine and the truth of God are often rejected by the world, and wicked people are angered by it. These people try to find ways to avoid creating conflict and hatred. If we were to interview people with some common sense today, hardly one in a hundred would admit to errors in the Papacy. Most would say that we shouldn’t ask them to abandon everything, but it would be enough if they got rid of some of their more unreasonable superstitions, even if they continued to hold onto many other corruptions. Why? Because they desire to be esteemed and respected, and they are willing to compromise the purity of the gospel to avoid persecution. What motivates them is their desire to be valued and have a good reputation. The devil, who has been causing this conflict since the days of Paul, continues to do so today. Therefore, we need to arm ourselves with this doctrine. The best remedy is the one that Paul proposes here: that we reject all boasting except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>To understand this clearly, we must remember what Jeremiah wrote, confirmed here by Paul. All human glory must be humbled so that God may be exalted as he deserves. Indeed, it is written that all the wisdom that people think they possess is nothing and will not be counted. It must be disregarded so that we may turn to God, who has all good things in himself. Let us acknowledge that all wisdom comes from his grace, so that we are enlightened by his Holy Spirit and strengthened by his might, despite our weaknesses and sinfulness. Righteousness may be restored in us according to his gift.</p>

<p>Now let us consider the means. It is not enough to know that God is our light, righteousness, wisdom, and strength. We must know how to obtain these graces in God. They are all communicated to us in Jesus Christ, who descended, made himself nothing, and was willingly crucified for our sakes. Therefore, since we lack these things, we must draw them from the Lord Jesus Christ. This is why Paul says that he sought only to boast in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus suffered a cruel and bitter death, exposed himself to God’s judgment on our behalf, and received our curse. In this way, he became our wisdom, righteousness, holiness, and strength.</p>

<p>Firstly, we must know who we are before we can boast only in the Lord Jesus Christ. Many people are proud without reason. All that they believe about themselves is nothing but vanity. They have not examined themselves properly to see their true condition and have not sought Jesus Christ. They are hypocrites, puffed up with presumption because of their supposed merits. Therefore, we must consider our wretched condition until the Lord Jesus takes pity on us. This is how we can prepare ourselves to come to him.</p>

<p>However, there are some who confess their sinfulness and vanity but continue in their sinful ways. They do not fear the judgment of God, and their minds have been lulled to sleep by the world. These pleasure-seekers cannot excuse their wickedness and ought to be ashamed of it, yet they take pleasure in sins and continue in them as if hardened. They have been intoxicated by the world and blinded by the devil, so they do not see that they must give an account of themselves. They have made themselves believe that they will always remain as they are, pursuing evil things, and that they will never have to face judgment. These are the reasons why they despise Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>We must rid ourselves of all pride and presumption, and feel so much shame that we have no rest until we find relief in the Lord Jesus Christ. We must open our eyes to see our depravity and be ashamed of it. We must recognize that this life is nothing and that God has placed us here as on a journey to test whether we are following him. May each of us come aside, both morning and evening, to consider our sins and may they prick us to come to God. May we not be tied to this world but be led by our need to come to the Lord Jesus Christ. This is what it means to boast in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Paul speaks of the cross here to knock down all haughtiness in man. We always want to maintain a certain dignity, but Paul shows us that Jesus Christ should be our only cause of boasting because he was crucified for us. Those who are not crucified to the world, who desire authority and honor, do not yet know what it is to boast in the cross of Jesus Christ. They are confused within themselves.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Paul boasted in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, he abandoned the world. By ‘world,’ he means all that appeals to our flesh, to people who do not think of God or eternal life, but are given over to greed or ambition. They are controlled by their own instincts and do not look beyond this world. But if all our boasting is in Jesus Christ, knowing that through his cross he has committed us to God the Father and secured the kingdom of heaven for us, then it will be easy for us to withdraw from the world. Whoever has been cut to the quick and overwhelmed with a sense of their own sin will seek the grace offered in Jesus Christ, and the world will be worth nothing to them.</p>

<p>We often treat the spiritual riches that God offers us as if they were nothing, because we value the things of this world too highly. We do not know the priceless riches God is offering us.”</p>

<p>“So, let’s unite these two ideas: being crucified to the world and the world to us, boasting only in Jesus Christ crucified. It’s easier said than done, but each of us, wherever we are, must strive to do so. Once we’ve heard this teaching, we must put it into practice. To be considered Christians before God and his angels, we must conform to what Paul tells us here. If we were truly introspective, we’d find plenty of reason to do so. When we look within ourselves and truly see our condition apart from Jesus Christ, we should be terrified at the wrath we deserve. We should feel ruined by our accursed state, wishing the earth would swallow us a hundred times over rather than live as enemies of God who cannot escape his hand. Let’s learn to examine ourselves honestly, without flattery. Recognizing our poverty and misery, let’s turn to the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>To be crucified to the world and ourselves with regard to the world means mortifying all our strong, consuming desires that lead us in various directions. We know that the Son of God had to suffer such a shameful death for our sake. How can we seek importance and glory in this world when the head of angels, Jesus Christ, was cursed and hated for us? We must mortify all our lusts so that our desires do not consume us. Likewise, we must consider the things of this world as corruptible in comparison to the spiritual riches offered by Jesus Christ. Let’s value God’s blessings and not become attached to or hindered by the world. This should always be our aim. If we become entangled in the love of this world, we’ll become alienated from God. This is the message we should take from this passage.</p>

<p>Paul adds that in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters, but being a new creation. Those troubling the church in Paul’s time were driven by ambition. Our aim should be to see the Son of God reigning among us, to be ruled by the Word of his gospel, and to live obediently to God, transformed in every aspect of our lives. The spiritual temple of God is built on faith and a new life, where we honor God for all his blessings and call on him together. This is what it means to be a new creature in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>This passage can also be applied to today’s context. Many pointless rituals and traditions are upheld by some to be holy, yet they are mere shadows that God has not commanded. Let’s live uprightly and honestly, knowing that charity is the bond of perfection, and let’s dedicate ourselves to God, living in holiness, and eagerly awaiting the return of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the starting point of holiness and perfection, as declared in God’s Word.”</p>

<p>Paul concludes his letter with a strong statement, saying, “And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.” By referring to this “rule,” he suggests that despite people’s beliefs, God remains unyielding and unchanging. Paul emphasizes that God’s established rule remains firm, regardless of human actions or desires. This should be obvious to everyone, as we all recognize God’s superiority over us. To suggest otherwise would be blasphemous. Yet, despite this acknowledgment, people often live without restraint, creating their own rules and expecting others to adhere to them. Everyone wants to establish their own guidelines. Even within Popery, while not everyone follows the rules of St. Francis or St. Dominic, each person has their own set of rules for living. This is true of people in general—everyone has their own way of approaching devotion, which often pushes God into the background. People insist on having the freedom to do what they think is right, expecting God to be content with their choices.</p>

<p>How audacious people can be! They compromise and deviate from the truth, creating twisted paths for themselves, hoping that God will bend his rules to accommodate their views. However, Paul makes it clear that while people may try to twist God’s rules to suit their desires, his rule remains unchanged and will continue on its course.</p>

<p>So, what is this rule? It is to strive for the perfection revealed by Jesus in the gospel. While we may not attain this perfection in our lifetime, we are called to aim for it without veering off course. This means denying ourselves and dedicating ourselves fully to God. Therefore, let us commit to following this rule and aligning our lives with it. Our natural inclination is to wander off course, but to stay on track, we must hold fast to all that God reveals and teaches us in his Word. Paul’s wish for peace and mercy upon those who follow this rule implies that even if the world condemns us, we can remain steadfast, knowing that God is with us. If God is for us, that should be enough. If we are shaken by the world’s foolish judgments and opinions, we are not giving God the honor he deserves. If people say we are not living righteously and we try to conform to their standards, we are moving away from God.</p>

<p>Therefore, let us heed Paul’s words and not be troubled by the world’s condemnation or criticism. It should be enough for us that God blesses us and offers us complete happiness. Even if we do not have all the virtues we should have, if we strive to follow God, he will always show us mercy and support us in our weaknesses and wretchedness. On the other hand, those who stray from God’s rule and make their own imaginations their law will face God’s judgment, no matter how highly they are esteemed by the world. This is a reminder that there is only one rule by which we must live, and that is the rule found in the gospel.</p>

<p>So, where does this rule lead us? It leads us to offer ourselves fully to God, recognizing that in Jesus Christ, we have all the perfection we need. We must be content with him alone, knowing that he is merciful and will bless and make us happy if we follow him. Those who deviate from this rule, no matter how highly praised by the world, will face God’s judgment.</p>

<p>By adding “the Israel of God,” Paul emphasizes that those who serve God spiritually will be acknowledged as his people. The enemies of Paul wanted to maintain all the ceremonial practices, believing them to be the marks of the true church. However, Paul rejects this notion, stating that God does not concern himself with such external practices. The true church is not defined by outward pomp and ceremonies but by those who bear the true mark of God. The church consists of those who follow Jesus Christ in simplicity and truth, not those who rely on human inventions and traditions.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let us adhere to the rule set forth by Paul—to aim for the perfection revealed in Jesus Christ and to submit ourselves fully to God and his Word. Let us not be swayed by the world’s standards of success or righteousness but remain steadfast in following God’s rule.</p>
