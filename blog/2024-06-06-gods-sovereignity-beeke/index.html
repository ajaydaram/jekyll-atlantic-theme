      <h3 id="gods-sovereignty">God’s Sovereignty</h3>

<h4 id="an-introduction-to-omnipotence">An Introduction to Omnipotence</h4>

<p>No rock is as hard as the heart of a person who loves their idols. Jesus said it’s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter God’s kingdom because of his “great possessions.” His disciples, confused, asked, “Who then can be saved?” Jesus replied, “With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible” (Matt. 19:25-26). God’s infinite power is good news for sinners. We can’t save ourselves, but Jesus can save anyone he chooses to, with his great love.</p>

<p>God is sovereign; He is the supreme ruler over all. This is a key teaching in the Bible, essential for a believer’s faith and hope. God’s sovereignty includes his divine nature, his plans for everything, his choosing of those he will save, and his control over all events through his providence.</p>

<h4 id="opposition-to-divine-sovereignty">Opposition to Divine Sovereignty</h4>

<p>God calls his people to be his witnesses and declare his unique glory as the sovereign Lord and Savior (Isa. 43:10-13). Charles Spurgeon said, “There is nothing for which the children of God ought more earnestly to contend than the dominion of their Master over all creation… Men will allow God to be everywhere except on his throne.”</p>

<p>Modern theology often reduces the doctrine of God’s sovereignty because people think it hinders love and relationships. John Cobb and David Griffin say that God “seeks to persuade” his creatures but “cannot control” events. Greg Boyd writes, “God rules by love, not control.” For John Sanders, God’s sovereignty means his freedom to limit his control to allow real relationships. Emil Brunner said, “God limits himself by creating something which is not himself,” a self-limitation from his love. Jürgen Moltmann suggests that if God is to be loving, he cannot be a controlling Lord.</p>

<p>However, the Bible never sees God’s creation as limiting his power. Creation shows his power and ability to rule the world as he chooses (Isa. 37:15-26; 44:24-28; Jer. 32:17). God can do whatever he wills in all events. The Lord says, “There is none who can deliver from my hand; I work, and who can turn it back?” (Isa. 43:13). Isaiah was not describing a tyrant but a Lord who saves his people because they are precious to him (vv. 2-4).</p>

<p>We don’t need to reject God’s sovereignty to affirm his love. God’s love is powerful enough to do good for all (Ps. 145:6-16) and redeem his people (Deut. 4:37; Eph. 2:4-5). George Swinnock said, “His arm is as large as his mind, and his hand equal to his heart.” Our hearts naturally oppose God’s sovereignty (Rom. 8:7), so we must pray for the Spirit to help us understand God’s power (Eph. 1:17-19).</p>

<h4 id="gods-names-of-sovereignty">God’s Names of Sovereignty</h4>

<p>One way God shows his sovereignty is through the names he gives himself in the Bible. The name YHWH shows his self-existence as “the Lord.” God’s sovereignty is linked to his nature as the independent “I Am” upon whom everything depends. Herman Hoeksema said, “Absolute sovereignty is not merely supreme or highest lordship; it is that virtue according to which God is sovereign in himself. His is the only sovereignty; there is no sovereignty anywhere except it is derived from his lordship.”</p>

<p>The first divine name in Scripture is Elohim, used thirty-five times in the first thirty-four verses of the Bible (Gen. 1:1-2:3). Elohim shows God as the powerful Sovereign who made and controls all things, but also as the God of love, giving all good things. The name Elohim suggests majesty and authority, and it is a plural of Eloah (Neh. 9:17; Job 3:4), similar to El, which appears in combinations like “mighty God” (El gibor). Elohim, Eloah, and El are often translated as Theos in the New Testament, denoting the powerful Creator-God.</p>

<p>The name ‘Elyon (Pss. 18:13; 73:11) means “Most High” and implies God’s supremacy over the world (Pss. 83:18; 97:9). It also suggests victory over nations (Gen. 14:18-20; Ps. 47:2-3; Deut. 26:19; 28:1). The Greek equivalent is Hupsistos, associated with the power that produced the incarnate Son of God (Luke 1:35).</p>

<p>God revealed himself to the patriarchs as El Shaddai, “God Almighty,” a name often found in Job. It is often translated as “Lord” (Kyrios) or “All-ruler” (Pantokrator). El Shaddai indicates God’s power to bless or destroy (Job 37:22-23; Gen. 28:3; Ps. 91:1).</p>

<p>The name Adonai, an intensified form of Adon, designates God as “Lord” or “Master,” indicating authority and a relationship of love and allegiance. Isaiah’s vision of the exalted King (Isa. 6:1-3) referred to Adonai. In the Septuagint, Adon and Adonai are rendered Kyrios, the New Testament term for “Lord.”</p>

<p>“The LORD of hosts” (YHWH Seb’aot) or “the LORD God of hosts” (YHWH Elohey Seb’aot) presents God as a commander of vast forces, including angels. This title emphasizes God’s sovereignty over all creation (Gen. 2:1), and appears in the New Testament as “the Lord of Sabaoth” (Rom. 9:29; James 5:4), often rendered “All-ruler” (Pantokrator).</p>

<p>The names of God in the Bible highlight his sovereignty. He is the God of creating and controlling power (Elohim), absolute supremacy (‘Elyon), majestic strength (Shaddai), and authority (Adonai), with vast armies at his command (YHWH Seb’aot). These titles teach the fear of the Lord, who inspires both dread in his enemies and hope in his servants. God is “King for ever and ever” (Ps. 10:16), “the King of glory” (Ps. 24:7-10), and “a great King over all the earth” (Ps. 47:2). He is “the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords” (1 Tim. 6:15).</p>

<h3 id="aspects-of-gods-sovereignty">Aspects of God’s Sovereignty</h3>

<h4 id="definition-of-sovereignty">Definition of Sovereignty</h4>
<p>God’s sovereignty means His supreme power and authority. He is supreme in His being, rights, and ability to rule and accomplish His will.</p>

<h4 id="gods-sovereign-will">God’s Sovereign Will</h4>
<p>From the Bible, it’s clear that God is a “voluntary agent,” meaning He acts intentionally and not mechanically. He is a wise moral agent who performs praiseworthy actions (Rev. 15:3). God’s will encompasses all His moral excellencies, but more specifically, it refers to the active, intelligent exercise of these attributes in His choices. God freely chooses His holy people, places, and officers (1 Sam. 16:10).</p>

<h4 id="the-purpose-of-gods-will">The Purpose of God’s Will</h4>
<p>The main purpose of God’s will is His glory. God knows His infinite greatness and goodness and loves Himself and His glory. As Paul says in Romans 11:36, everything is for God’s glory. God created the world out of His free choice, not because He needed to. His creation and actions manifest His goodness and glory. Divine love flows eternally within God, extends freely into the world, and returns to His own glory.</p>

<h4 id="distinctions-in-gods-will">Distinctions in God’s Will</h4>
<p>The Bible speaks of God’s will toward His creatures in two ways: what they should do and what they will do. The first is about God’s commands (preceptive will), and the second is about what actually happens (decretive will).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Preceptive Will:</strong> This is what God instructs us to do, such as moral duties. For example, Paul writes that God’s will is our sanctification and avoidance of sin (1 Thess. 4:3). Christ taught us to pray for God’s will to be done on earth as it is in heaven (Matt. 6:10). This will is often resisted by humans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Decretive Will:</strong> This is God’s plan for what will actually happen in history. For example, God created everything according to His will (Rev. 4:11), and He continues to govern all things (Ps. 115:3; Dan. 4:17). God decides who will be saved and the roles within the church (Rom. 9:18; 1 Cor. 12:18). Everything happens according to God’s will (Eph. 1:11).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="gods-will-and-salvation">God’s Will and Salvation</h4>
<p>In the New Testament, God’s will primarily refers to His plan of salvation through Christ. This plan is executed by the Holy Spirit and through the preaching of the gospel. Isaiah 53:10 shows that Christ’s death was according to God’s will. God was pleased to reconcile sinners through Christ.</p>

<p>By understanding these aspects of God’s sovereignty, we can see that His supreme authority and will are central to the functioning of the world and the unfolding of His redemptive plan.</p>

<h1 id="gods-sovereign-authority-and-power">God’s Sovereign Authority and Power</h1>

<h2 id="gods-sovereign-authority">God’s Sovereign Authority</h2>

<p>Absolute freedom to do one’s will without proper authority would result in a monstrosity of injustice. God’s freedom to do with all creatures as He pleases is rooted in the fact that He is the Creator of all things. Psalm 24:1-2 states, “The earth is the LORD’s, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.” Therefore, God has the right to impose His will both in what He decrees and what He commands. He is “the most high [‘Elyon] over all the earth” (Ps. 83:18; cf. 97:9) and “the LORD [Adon] of all the earth” (Josh. 3:11, 13; Zech. 6:5). God’s authority is also grounded upon His absolute moral excellence: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne” (Ps. 97:2 ESV; cf. 89:14).</p>

<p>No one has a greater right to reign than the Lord. The better we know God’s authority, the more we will rejoice that He reigns. Douglas Kelly remarks, “The majestic character of the ‘King of Kings and Lord of Lords’ means that nothing can be more uplifting and beautiful than to know that he is in charge of all that can ever happen.” No other being is so worthy of our submission, trust, and obedience. Whatever we are and whatever we have, it is the Lord’s. God’s ownership of the world grants Him the liberty to use it as He wills.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar confessed, “All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?” (Dan. 4:35). God is not accountable to anyone, and no one can rightly interrogate Him for His actions, much less accuse Him of wrongdoing (Job 9:12). For man to demand explanations of God or bring charges against Him would be a “turning of things upside down,” for He is the Potter and we the clay (Isa. 29:16). “Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker!” Isaiah exclaimed. “Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou?” (45:9). The apostle Paul quoted Isaiah’s words to silence those who argue against God’s predestination of some people to mercy and glory, but other people to wrath and destruction (Rom. 9:19-23). If God has the right to determine the eternal destinies of human beings, then He has the freedom to grant or withhold lesser blessings as He sees fit. The Master says, “Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?” (Matt. 20:15).</p>

<p>Divine ownership of the world also confirms God’s supreme authority to demand from angels and men complete obedience to His commands. He gives sufficient reason for us to keep all His statutes by simply saying, “I am the Lord” (Lev. 18:4-5; 19:37). God has all legislative, executive, and judicial authority concentrated in Himself, and He uses it for the good of His people: “For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king; he will save us” (Isa. 33:22). When it comes to moral law that binds the conscience, “there is one lawgiver,” the almighty God alone (James 4:12).</p>

<p>God has granted the incarnate and risen Mediator supreme authority over the universe (Phil. 1:9-11). Christ says, “The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand” (John 3:35). We must “make disciples of all nations” and teach them to obey all that Christ commanded because “all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to” the resurrected God-man (Matt. 28:18-20 ESV). Christ exercises that authority through the Holy Spirit, who exercises absolute authority over the ministry of the church (Acts 13:1-4).</p>

<p>God’s supreme authority transcends the authority and rights of all other beings and grounds them in Himself (Rom. 13:1). We must learn to look past mere men and always live before the Lord. Though we wrong others, in an ultimate sense, all our sins are against Him alone (Ps. 51:4). Likewise, all our obedience, though we must obey all legitimate authority in its proper sphere, is finally to Him alone (Col. 3:23-25). Consequently, when human authorities demand that we disobey God, then “we ought to obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29). We must fear the Lord above all earthly kings (Ex. 1:17) and serve Him alone, even if it requires us to yield up our bodies to death at the hands of persecutors (Dan. 3:18, 28).</p>

<p>The doctrine of God’s sovereignty strengthened the martyrs. After civil authorities had killed the Scottish Covenanter Richard Cameron (c. 1648-1680), they cruelly presented his severed head and hands to his imprisoned father, Alan Cameron. The grieving father looked upon his son’s remains and said, “I know them. They are my son’s, my own dear son’s. It is the Lord. Good is the will of the Lord, who cannot wrong me nor mine, but has made goodness and mercy to follow us all our days.”</p>

<p>We should obey God with a profound sense that it is His right to command us as He pleases. Edward Leigh said, “We should perform all duties to him with the greatest care, diligence and reverence, and in the highest degree; love him greatly, fear him greatly, praise him with all our might, yield unto him a service proportionable to his incomprehensible greatness.”</p>

<h2 id="gods-sovereign-power">God’s Sovereign Power</h2>

<p>The Lord has infinite power to accomplish all His decretive will and enforce the full rights of His authority. He demonstrated that power in the work of creation, where His mere word of command or fiat, “Let there be,” brought the world into existence and gave it order (Gen. 1:3, etc.). The divine agent of this creative word is the Spirit (v. 2). We should fear God and give Him glory, for “by the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth… For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast” (Ps. 33:6, 9). This was no laborious work, but the bare expression of the divine will executed through the divine Spirit. God’s mere will is powerful and effective, as we see in creation by divine fiat. William Ames said that faith says to God, “Lord, if you will, you can,” and the Lord replies, “I will; therefore, it is done” (cf. Matt. 8:2-3).</p>

<p>In other words, God’s actual power is His decretive will operating to produce effects outside of Himself. However, we may distinguish God’s will and power by the distinction between God’s inward (ad intra) activity and His outward (ad extra) activity. Ordinarily, we will refer to God’s inward act as “will” and His outward act as “power.” This helps us to distinguish between God’s eternal decree and His execution of that decree in history by His providence.</p>

<p>Creation demonstrates the amazing fullness of God’s power. He made the whole universe out of nothing, but, as Thomas Watson noted, “All the world cannot make a fly.” The majestic heavens express only a “little” of His strength, and “the thunder of his power who can understand?” (Job 26:14). Stephen Charnock commented, “Though there be a mighty expression of divine power in his works, yet an incomprehensible power pertains to his nature.” Only the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit know the infinite vigor of the one divine life they share. It is somewhat revealed, though, in God’s works of providence (Acts 17:25). God brought the blessed seed, Isaac, out of an elderly, barren couple: “Is any thing too hard for the LORD?” (Gen. 18:14). Though sorely tried by his afflictions, Job learned to say, “I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought of thine can be hindered” (Job 42:2 KJV mg). Neither can God’s power ever be diminished or exhausted, for “the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary” (Isa. 40:28). When the armies of Babylon prepared to destroy Jerusalem, Jeremiah prayed, “Ah Lord God! Behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee” (Jer. 32:17).</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus is the embodiment of divine power, the “arm of the LORD” hidden in human weakness to save God’s people (Isa. 52:10; 53:1-2). Christ is the divine Son of God, “by whom also he made the worlds,” the Son who, throughout history, has been “upholding all things by the word of his power” (Heb. 1:2-3). John Owen noted, “He who upholdeth all things by the word of his power is God.” In Christ, the Almighty came to us in flesh, and His life on earth was a veiled expression of omnipotence, as He healed the sick, cast out demons, and calmed the storm.</p>

<p>In Jesus Christ, God’s power has been transformed into the strength of our redemption (Isa. 63:1). He defeated the devil, bound him with chains of spiritual darkness, and destroyed the works of the devil (Matt. 12:28-29; 1 John 3:8). The divine power of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit raises people out of spiritual death, delivers them from sin, and transforms them to be like Christ (Eph. 2:5-10; 2 Pet. 1:3-4). Because of God’s power, the weakest believer has infinite resources available for spiritual warfare. Therefore, God calls us to “be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might” (Eph. 6:10). And the grace of God gives us hope beyond the grave: “For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself” (Phil. 3:20-21).</p>

<p>God’s infinite power also gives infinite weight to His moral government of the world. He exercises perfect justice because “our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him” (Ps. 50:3). We should tremble with awe before the “great and terrible God” (Neh. 1:5) and “fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell” (Matt. 10:28). The gospel warns us of “the wrath of the Lamb” and “the great day of his wrath” from which no one can escape (Rev. 6:16-17). All creation will flee from “a great white throne” when God “shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ” (20:11-12; Rom. 2:16). In the end, God will cast the damned into “the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone,” a fate of “everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels” (Rev. 21:8; Matt. 25:41).</p>

<p>How then should we respond to God’s sovereignty and power? Let us bow down in humble worship before the Almighty. Let us strive to know God and His will through His Word, seeking the transforming power of the Holy Spirit to live lives that reflect His glory. May we proclaim the gospel boldly, knowing that God has the power to save and transform lives. And let us rest in the assurance that our God, who is sovereign and powerful, is in control of all things, working everything for our good and His glory.</p>

<h2 id="practical-applications">Practical Applications</h2>

<p>The doctrine of God’s power and sovereignty has extensive and profound practical applications for the believer’s life. Here are several key implications for our meditation and spiritual growth:</p>

<h3 id="1-repentance-from-rebellion">1. <strong>Repentance from Rebellion</strong></h3>
<p>God’s sovereignty calls us to turn away from rebellion. As Job 9:4 states, “He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?” It is futile to fight against the omnipotent God. The psalmist marvels at the futility of human rebellion in Psalm 2:1-9. Thus, the wisest course is to bow before God in repentance and humility. For those who have repented, this calls for a continuous battle against any remaining rebellion in their hearts.</p>

<h3 id="2-trust-in-gods-promises">2. <strong>Trust in God’s Promises</strong></h3>
<p>God’s sovereignty assures us that His promises are reliable, even when they seem impossible. Abraham’s faith in God’s promise of a son despite his and Sarah’s old age (Genesis 18:14) exemplifies this. We must believe that God can sustain us in our trials and rescue us from danger. A robust confidence in God’s power is essential for trusting His promises, as illustrated in Romans 4:21. This faith is crucial for our perseverance in sanctification, knowing that God can conquer our deepest sins.</p>

<h3 id="3-reverent-fear">3. <strong>Reverent Fear</strong></h3>
<p>A recognition of God’s immense power should lead to a reverent fear of Him. We should fear God not only because of His ability to create the universe with a word but also because of what it would mean for such a powerful God to be angry with us (Psalm 33:8-9; Psalm 90:11). However, for those who fear Him, His power is a source of protection and confidence.</p>

<h3 id="4-humble-praise">4. <strong>Humble Praise</strong></h3>
<p>God’s sovereignty should elicit humble praise. We are called to joyfully worship Him, recognizing His greatness and dominion (Psalm 95:1-6). Even in times of trouble, we should praise God, acknowledging His sovereignty and trusting in His goodness, as Job did (Job 1:21).</p>

<h3 id="5-faithful-service">5. <strong>Faithful Service</strong></h3>
<p>Recognizing God’s sovereignty reminds us that any authority or influence we have is delegated from Him. We are stewards of His creation, charged to use our positions for His glory (Genesis 1:26; Ephesians 6:9). Our wisdom lies in cheerful obedience to His commands, aligning our will with His.</p>

<h3 id="6-submission-in-sorrows">6. <strong>Submission in Sorrows</strong></h3>
<p>God’s sovereignty helps us submit to His will in times of suffering. When faced with adversity, we should trust that God, in His omnipotence, knows what is best for us (1 Samuel 3:18). This truth allows us to find hope in God’s mercies and faithfulness, even when we do not understand His ways (Lamentations 3:21-29, 37-38).</p>

<h3 id="7-hope-for-the-salvation-of-others">7. <strong>Hope for the Salvation of Others</strong></h3>
<p>God’s sovereignty gives us hope for the salvation of even the hardest hearts. Knowing that “with God all things are possible” (Mark 10:27), we can remain hopeful and persistent in praying for and witnessing to those who seem far from God. The conversion of Saul of Tarsus (Acts 9) reminds us that God can transform anyone according to His will.</p>

<h3 id="8-boldness-in-prayer">8. <strong>Boldness in Prayer</strong></h3>
<p>Understanding God’s power encourages us to pray boldly. Paul’s prayers for the saints in Ephesians 3:20 demonstrate high aspirations, reminding us that God can do far more than we ask or think. John Newton’s hymn encourages us to bring large petitions to God, knowing that His grace and power are limitless.</p>

<p>These practical applications of God’s sovereignty and power remind us to live in humble submission, trust, reverence, praise, faithful service, and hope. They encourage us to repent from rebellion, trust God’s promises, fear Him rightly, praise Him humbly, serve Him faithfully, submit to His will in suffering, hope for the salvation of others, and pray boldly. In all these ways, we acknowledge and respond to the sovereign power of our Almighty God.</p>
